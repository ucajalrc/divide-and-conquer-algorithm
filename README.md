# Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of Merge Sort and Quick Sort as part of a course assignment analyzing divide-and-conquer algorithms.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8 or higher** is strongly recommended.

## Files

- `index.py`: Contains all code for running and benchmarking both algorithms including its speed and memory usage.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Run the script:  
   `python3 index.py` OR *(If your system uses `python` for Python 3, you may use `python index.py` instead.)*


The script will automatically generate random, sorted, and reverse-sorted arrays of various sizes and print timing and memory usage results.

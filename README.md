# Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of Merge Sort and Quick Sort as part of a course assignment analyzing divide-and-conquer algorithms.

## Files

- `index.py`: Contains all code for running and benchmarking both algorithms including its speed and memory usage.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Run the script:
